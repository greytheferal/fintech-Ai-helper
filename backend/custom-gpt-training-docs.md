# Financial Chatbot - Custom GPT Model Training Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the process used to create a custom AI assistant for the financial transaction processing chatbot.

## Training Data
For our custom GPT model, we prepared the following types of training data:

### 1. FAQ Knowledge Base
- Basic financial concepts (credit vs. debit, APR vs. APY, etc.)
- Product information (checking, savings, credit cards)
- Service information (transfer methods, transaction statuses)
- Advanced financial education (compound interest, opportunity cost, inflation)

### 2. Database Schema
- The model has been trained with understanding of the database schema to ensure it can correctly handle data retrieval requests.

### 3. Response Templates
- The model has been trained with specific response templates for various scenarios to maintain consistency.

## Training Process
1. **Data Preparation**: Financial FAQ data was prepared covering key customer queries.
2. **Embeddings Generation**: Text embeddings were created using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.
3. **Database Storage**: Embeddings and text content were stored in the database for retrieval.
4. **System Prompt Engineering**: Custom instructions were created to define the assistant's personality, knowledge boundaries, and response format.
5. **Function Calling**: The model was configured with function definitions for specific tasks (balance inquiry, transaction status, etc.)

## Integration Method
The custom GPT model is integrated into the application through:
1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): Using OpenAI API with database-stored embeddings
2. Function calling: Defining specific functions the model can invoke
3. System prompt: Providing consistent instructions to guide the model's behavior

## Configuration
The model uses the following configuration:
- Base Model: GPT-4
- Temperature: 0.2 (for consistent, predictable responses)
- Functions: Predefined for handling specific banking queries
- Embeddings Model: text-embedding-ada-002
- Vector Similarity: Cosine similarity for FAQ matching

## Evaluation
The model was evaluated on:
- Intent recognition accuracy
- Response quality and helpfulness
- Handling of edge cases and ambiguous queries
- Appropriate escalation to human agents
- Response time

## Usage Notes
- The model excels at handling common banking queries but will escalate complex or unusual situations
- It does not store personal information between sessions
- It has appropriate guardrails to prevent disclosure of sensitive information

## Future Improvements
- Continuous addition of new FAQs based on user interactions
- Fine-tuning with feedback from customer interactions
- Expanding function capability as new features are added to the platform
